# nba_player_roles
Using unsupervised learning to cluster nba players together based on careeer statistical output.

In this project I plan to leverage my understanding of both unsupervised learning and the NBA to define the five main roles that every NBA team is and has been composed of. I use the career statistical output of all NBA players to build various clustering models and then evaluate the clusters quantitatively and qualitatively.
